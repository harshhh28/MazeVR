# Croaking Kero C Libraries

These libraries are developed by me, Nick Walton, as they're needed while developing games and tutorials. Many of them will be used as examples for my C tutorials at http://croakingkero.com/blog

Currently all libs are single header files. Just download whichever ones you want, add their include directory to your project and go.

# These libraries are not good and you shouldn't use them!
